CMPSC 121 was a class I took in spring semester of 2014. It was my first time actually programming. And now I'm a professional developer :) . The source code is 100% intact, however I added a makefile to run each homework easily. When I took the class, we used visual studio to build and run.

To run old versions:
```bash 
cd 121-old
make TARGET=<hw-#> run
```


To run modern, remade versions:
```bash
cd 121-new/kotlin
./gradlew <HW#>
```
